To create web page i used html,css and javascript. First, there are three links, that clicable and link to instagram page, watsapp and github page. There ara four sections, first is to create row for whrite information about me and devide it to make stylish page. Second section is for contact information, also to devide images. Third section for icons to social media. I used css to make page colorful, resize and add other options. I add embedded video from youtube about autmn, think it is topical now.
